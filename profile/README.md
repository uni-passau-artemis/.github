# Artemis at the University of Passau, Germany

The [Chair of Software Engineering II](https://github.com/se2p/)
and the [Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/)
at the University of Passau
maintain an instance of the [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis) interactive learning platform
to support the exercise submission and grading workflow for our courses.

If you also want to test/use Artemis as part of your courses at the University of Passau, please
contact us.
We are happy to set up additional courses in our shared instance and offer some guidance in how to use
Artemis.

This GitHub organisation contains various helper tools and container images used to set up those exercises.
