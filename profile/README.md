The [Chair of Software Engineering II](https://github.com/se2p/)
and the [Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/)
at the University of Passau
maintain an instance of the [Artemis](https://github.com/ls1intum/Artemis) interactive learning platform
to support the exercise submission and grading workflow for our courses.

This GitHub organisation contains various helper tools and container images used to set up those exercises.
